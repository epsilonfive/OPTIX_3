Structs
-------
optix_transform: a general transform structure, used for many of the GUI elements
                 - contents:
                 - x: an x-coordinate
                 - y: a y-coordinate
                 - width: a width value
                 - height: a height value
optix_state:     a general state structure, containing information about the selection and visibility status of an elements
                 - contents:
                 - selected: whether or not this item is currently selected
                 - visible: whether or not this item is visible; only visible items are updated
optix_widget:    the first element of all of the GUI element structs
                 - contents:
                 - type: the type of the item (ex: OPTIX_BUTTON_TYPE, OPTIX_MENU_TYPE)
                 - transform: an optix_transform
                 - state: an optix_state
                 - render: a render callback, taking an optix_widget * as an argument
                 - update: an update callback, taking an optix_widget * as an argument
                 - child: an array of optix_widget * that will be the children of the object (set to NULL if there are
                          none, and end with a NULL if there are)
optix_button:    a GUI button
                 - contents:
                 - widget: an optix_widget
                 - click_action: a function to be run when the button is pressed
                 - click_args: the pointer to be passed to click_action on the button press, intended to be used to pass
                               arguments on click_action, of any type that is desired (use a struct if there are more
                               than one argument)
                 - pressed: whether or not the button has been pressed (used internally so that the button action is not
                            many times when holding the selection key over a button)
Commands
--------
void optix_InitializeCursor(void): initializes the cursor to be in in its default position in the middle of the screen,
                                   to use optix_UpdateCursor_default as its update callback, and
                                   optix_RenderCursor_default as its render callback
finish this later, I don't feel like doing it now
